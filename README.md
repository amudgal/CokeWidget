Coke Widget
The [ROW TITLE] Should be in the order
1. 

Considerations
1. The widget grid "Order" needs to be in front. If not the other elements of the document would be overlaying on top of the pop up/
2. Incremental fetch in grid embedded in the document should be either disabled or be put > 70. If not then partial data is going to be displayed in the widget.
